#  Original project: https://github.com/EnotPoloskun/spherov2.py
#
#  library spherov2 was originally created for educational use in CIS 521: 
#  Artificial Intelligence at the University of Pennsylvania, where Sphero 
#  robots are used to help teach the foundations of AI.
#
#
#  This extension was developed by:
#       Kathryn Kasmarik (kathryn.kasmarik@unsw.edu.au)
#       Reda Ghanem (reda.ghanem@unsw.edu.au)
#  From the School of Systems and Computing, UNSW Canberra, to support the Sphero BOLT+ robot.
#
#  This extension has been developed for educational use as part of the course ZEIT1102:
#  Introduction to Programming at the University of New South Wales, Canberra (UNSW Canberra).
#  It is specifically designed to support students in learning programming fundamentals and 
#  introductory robotics concepts through hands-on activities using Sphero BOLT+ robots.
